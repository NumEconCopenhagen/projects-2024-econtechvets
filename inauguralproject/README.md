# Inaugural project
The purpose of this project is to analyze a exchange economy with two consumers, A and B, and two goods, x1 and x2. We assume a set of initial endowments, specific utility and demand functions, and we generally solve for the Walras market equilibrium requiring market clearing for both goods. 
The project consists of:
1. Calculating the errors in the market clearing conditions
2. Finding the market equilibrium when assuming that A chooses the price to maximize her own utility
3. Finding the market equilibrium when assuming that A chooses Bâ€™s consumption, but such that B is not worse of than in the initial endowment. A is thus the market maker.
4. Finding the market equilibrium for chosen by a utilitarian social planner to maximize aggregate utility.

Finally, we illusrate our findings in an edgeworth box and find the market equilibrium for a allocation for a randomly drawn set.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb). We have collected most of our code in the .py-file such that the notebook mostly shows your results, comments to results and discussions.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
