# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Modelproject, IS-LM** and considers an IS-LM model describing the interaction between the goods and money market on the basis of the IS- and LM-curve. We illustrate how the economy reaches equilibrium in the short run when considering both real and monetary factors. Our project is split up into sections in the following way:
1. **Model description:** we describe how the model is set-up and define the relevant equations
2. **Analytical solution:** we calculate the analytical solution of our model
3. **Numerical solution:** we calculate the numerical solution of our model and test for different scenarios
4. **Model extension:** we extend to model to have proportional taxes instead of lump-sum taxes
5. **Conclusion:** we conclude on our findings

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb), which depends on [modelproject.py](modelproject.py) where most of the actual code has solving the model has been written. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
